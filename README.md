# Neural Network Challenge

This is a module challenge as part of AI Bootcamp and covers implementation of Sequential Model from Keras Tensorflow. 

### Data
Data used for this analysis is of Student Loans, features contributing to see if a student is eligible or not.

### Neural Network
K-means clustering is to group/cluster features to nearest mean value. You can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#:~:text=k%2Dmeans%20clustering%20is%20a,a%20prototype%20of%20the%20cluster)  

Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is used to analyze large data sets by reducing it to low dimnestion and maintaing as much variance as possible. Read more about PCA [here](https://rpubs.com/cyobero/pca-clustering)  

### Tensorlfow
We are using kmeans, PCA and StandardScaler modules from scikit.learn.
